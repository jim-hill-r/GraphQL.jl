# Julia GraphQL
A Julia implementation of GraphQL. This implementation is highly opinionated toward schema first design.

This is a personal hobby project designed to extend my knowledge of Julia and GraphQL internals. The long term mission is to provide production grade GraphQL tools native to the Julia ecosystem. Contributions and sponsorships are highly encouraged.
